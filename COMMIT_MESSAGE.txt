feat: Redesign AI Magic Controls View for cleaner, distraction-free transcription experience

Major UX improvements to AIMagicControlsView focusing on readability and minimalism:

## UX Changes

### Layout Redesign
- **Before**: Single scrollable view with mixed content (headers, buttons, transcription)
- **After**: 80/20 split layout - top 80% dedicated to transcription text, bottom 20% for action button

### Removed UI Elements
- ❌ Removed "AI Magic Controls" header section
- ❌ Removed book title display from header
- ❌ Removed manual "Transcribe" button (now automatic)
- ❌ Removed "Clear Database" debug button
- ❌ Removed status/progress bar section
- ❌ Removed "Transcription Results" headline with sentence count
- ❌ Removed sentence numbers (1, 2, 3...) from display
- ❌ Removed timestamps from sentence display
- ❌ Removed Cancel button from navigation bar

### Added/Improved UI Elements
- ✅ Status display moved to navigation bar (emoji + short text when transcribing):
  - ⚙️ Preparing...
  - 📚 Checking model...
  - ✂️ Extracting...
  - 🎤 Transcribing...
  - 💾 Saving...
  - ✅ Complete
- ✅ "What did I miss?" button in bottom 20% (placeholder for future AI feature)
- ✅ Clean text-only sentence display (numbers/timestamps still stored, just not shown)
- ✅ Simplified navigation (only "Done" button)

### User Benefits
- **More screen space**: 80% of view dedicated to actual transcription content
- **Distraction-free**: Removed all metadata and controls from main view
- **Better focus**: Users can focus on reading transcribed text without visual clutter
- **Status awareness**: Transcription status visible but non-intrusive in navigation bar
- **Cleaner design**: Minimalist approach improves readability

### Technical Changes
- Refactored `transcriptionContentView` from function with proxy parameter to computed property
- Moved `onChange` handler for `highlightedSentenceID` to parent view level
- Improved auto-scroll behavior with animation
- Windowed loading (30s before, 75s after current position) for efficient display

This redesign prioritizes the core user experience of reading transcribed text while maintaining
all functionality through automatic background processing and subtle status indicators.
